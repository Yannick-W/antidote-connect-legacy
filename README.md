# Antidote-Connect

See [antidote-connect](https://github.com/peterzeller/antidote-connect) for the original build and **usage** information.

This Dockerfile builds the go executable with the golang v1.13 image.
This might solve some issues when trying to run the image from older systems.

The idea comes from [here](https://dev.to/ivan/go-build-a-minimal-docker-image-in-just-three-steps-514i).
